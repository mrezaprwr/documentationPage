			<p>Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. 
				Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable.
				The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.

				The easiest way to try out Vue.js is using the JSFiddle Hello World example. 
				Feel free to open it in another tab and follow along as we go through some basic examples. 
				Or, you can create an index.html file and include Vue with:
			</p>
			<code>
				Original source code will be attached here.
				<br>
				Original source code will be attached here.
			</code>
			<p>
				The Installation page provides more options of installing Vue.
				Note: We do not recommend that beginners start with vue-cli, 
				especially if you are not yet familiar with Node.js-based build tools.
			</p>

			<p>
				At the core of Vue.js is a system that enables us to declaratively render data to the DOM 
				using straightforward template syntax:
			</p>
			<code>
				Original source code will be attached here.
				<br>
				Original source code will be attached here.
			</code>	
			<code>
				Original source code will be attached here.
				<br>
				Original source code will be attached here.
			</code>	
			<div class="output">
				Output of code will be shown here.
			</div>
			<p>
				We have already created our very first Vue app! This looks pretty similar to rendering a string template, 
				but Vue has done a lot of work under the hood. 
				The data and the DOM are now linked, and everything is now reactive. 
			</p>
			<code>
				Original source code will be attached here.
				<br>
				Original source code will be attached here.
			</code>	
			<code>
				Original source code will be attached here.
				<br>
				Original source code will be attached here.
			</code>	
			<div class="output">
				Output of code will be shown here.
			</div>
			<p>
				Here we are encountering something new. The v-bind attribute you are seeing is called a directive. 
				Directives are prefixed with v- to indicate that they are special attributes provided by Vue, 
				and as you may have guessed, they apply special reactive behavior to the rendered DOM.
			</p>

			<p>
				It’s easy to toggle the presence of an element, too:
			</p>
			<code>
				Original source code will be attached here.
				<br>
				Original source code will be attached here.
			</code>	
			<code>
				Original source code will be attached here.
				<br>
				Original source code will be attached here.
			</code>	
			<div class="output">
				Output of code will be shown here.
			</div>
			<p>
				Go ahead and enter app3.seen = false in the console. You should see the message disappear.
			</p>
			<p>
				This example demonstrates that we can bind data to not only text and attributes, 
				but also the structure of the DOM. Moreover, Vue also provides a powerful transition effect system 
				that can automatically apply transition effects when elements are inserted/updated/removed by Vue.

			</code>	
			<div class="output">
				Output of code will be shown here.
			</div>
			<p>
				In the console, enter app4.todos.push({ text: 'New item' }). 
				You should see a new item appended to the list.
