			<p>Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. 
				Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable.
				The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.

				The easiest way to try out Vue.js is using the JSFiddle Hello World example. 
				Feel free to open it in another tab and follow along as we go through some basic examples. 
				Or, you can create an index.html file and include Vue with:
			</p>
			<code class="block-code">
				Original source code will be attached here.
				<br>
				Original source code will be attached here.
			</code>
			<p>
				The Installation page provides more options of installing Vue.
				Note: We do not recommend that beginners start with vue-cli, 
				especially if you are not yet familiar with Node.js-based build tools.

			<p>
				At the core of Vue.js is a system that enables us to declaratively render data to the DOM 
				using straightforward template syntax:
			</p>
			<code class="block-code">
				Original source code will be attached here.
				<br>
				Original source code will be attached here.
			</code>	
			<ul>
				<li>
					Vue also provides the <code>v-model</code>directive that makes two-way binding between form input and app state a breeze:
				</li>
				<li>
					To let users interact with your app, we can use the <code>v-on</code> directive to attach event listeners that invoke methods on our Vue instances:
				</li>
				<li>
					We’ve briefly introduced the most basic features of Vue.js core - the rest of this guide will cover them and other advanced features with much finer details, so make sure to read through it all!
				</li>
			</ul>
			<code class="block-code">
				Original source code will be attached here.
				<br>
				Original source code will be attached here.
			</code>	
			<div class="output">
				Output of code will be shown here.
			</div>
			<p>
				We have already created our very first Vue app! This looks pretty similar to rendering a string template, 
				but Vue has done a lot of work under the hood. 
				The data and the DOM are now linked, and everything is now reactive. 
			</p>
			<code class="block-code">
				Original source code will be attached here.
				<br>
				Original source code will be attached here.
			</code>	
			<ul>
				<li>
					Go ahead and enter <code>app3.seen = false</code>in the console. You should see the message disappear.
				</li>
				<li>
					Now you can compose it in another component’s template:
				</li>
			</ul>
			<code class="block-code">
				Original source code will be attached here.
				<br>
				Original source code will be attached here.
			</code>	
			<div class="output">
				Output of code will be shown here.
			</div>
			<p>
				Here we are encountering something new. The v-bind attribute you are seeing is called a directive. 
				Directives are prefixed with v- to indicate that they are special attributes provided by Vue, 
				and as you may have guessed, they apply special reactive behavior to the rendered DOM.
			</p>

			<p>
				It’s easy to toggle the presence of an element, too:
			</p>
			<code class="block-code">
				Original source code will be attached here.
				<br>
				Original source code will be attached here.
			</code>	
			<code class="block-code">
				Original source code will be attached here.
				<br>
				Original source code will be attached here.
			</code>	
			<div class="output">
				Output of code will be shown here.
			</div>
			<p>
				Go ahead and enter app3.seen = false in the console. You should see the message disappear.
			</p>
			<p>
				This example demonstrates that we can bind data to not only text and attributes, 
				but also the structure of the DOM. Moreover, Vue also provides a powerful transition effect system 
				that can automatically apply transition effects when elements are inserted/updated/removed by Vue.
			</p>
			<code class="block-code">
				Original source code will be attached here.
				<br>
				Original source code will be attached here.
			</code>	
			<code class="block-code">
				Original source code will be attached here.
				<br>
				Original source code will be attached here.
			</code>	
			<div class="output">
				Output of code will be shown here.
			</div>
			<p>
				In the console, enter <code>app4.todos.push({ text: 'New item' }). </code>
				You should see a new item appended to the list.
